## Gaming layer

### Claude response

Looking at your current left-half accessibility, here are useful gaming
keys you're currently missing that would be great to add to a gaming
layer:

Essential gaming keys not on your left half:

1. M - Maps (as you noted)
2. I - Inventory (extremely common in RPGs, survival games, looters)
3. ESC - Wait, you have this via combo (15+16), but direct access might be better for pausing
4. 6-9, 0 - Extended weapon/ability slots (you only have 1-5)
5. P - Pause menu
6. N - Notes/objectives/waypoints
7. H - Help/hints
8. J - Journal/quest log
9. L - Loot/interact (common alternate to F)
10. Y - Chat response (common in multiplayer games)
11. ENTER - Chat/confirmation
12. Tilde/Grave - Console commands
13. Function keys (F1-F12) - Quick access without needing both hands

Current left-half coverage is good for:

- WASD movement ✓
- QERF abilities ✓
- 1-5 weapon/ability slots ✓
- TAB scoreboard ✓
- SPACE jump ✓
- Shift/Ctrl via NUMBER layer ✓

Suggestions for your gaming layer:
Consider mapping the right half of your gaming layer to commonly-needed
keys like I, M, N, P, and extended numbers (6-0), since your left hand
will be on the left half during gameplay. You might also want quick
access to F-keys and ESC without combos.
